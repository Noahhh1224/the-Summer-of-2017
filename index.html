  <h1> Artistic Statement: the Summer of 2017</h1>
  <h2>by Noah</h2>

    It is tough to understand what she is doing when a woman is standing in a picture, looking back at the audience and smiling. It is also hard for viewers to understand the mood by the moment as well. My concept of this installation is the same with photography: to document moments. However, the Summer of 2017 records my feelings and invisible emotions instead of recording forms. I believe with certain elements, for example, in this artwork, I used color, space, voice lines and music, certain emotions of people can be evoked. Aside from the thinking of the meaning of photography, the Summer of 2017 is a monument of a piece of my personal experience. I hope to record my attitude toward that period throughout this art installation. After all, as an art piece, I insisted on putting in a fair amount of aesthetic elements, trying to optimize the visual effect. By utilizing transparent gauzes, light tubes, <a href="htts://https://www.youtube.com" target="watch?v=p6JeRbRqufQ">video projections</a>, and 3D sound effects, I merge the installation into the space and build connections between the audience and the elements.
